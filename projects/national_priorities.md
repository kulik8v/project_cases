## Project Description

The autonomous non-profit organisation National Priorities informs citizens about the opportunities and results of national projects, and is also engaged in increasing people's participation in their implementation.

The company provides communication and information support for such national projects as demography, labour productivity and employment support, safe and quality roads, and many others.

In addition, National Priorities monitors, designs and develops formats for citizen participation in national projects.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of the project were to automate and simplify the routine work of employees and to switch to the "Single Window" format of work.

Main objectives of the project:

* Implement a corporate service with a user-friendly interface that would broadcast the company's principles, orienting employees towards achieving corporate goals.
* Increase staff loyalty and efficiency.
* Integrate the new corporate portal with P7-Office (this is a Russian cross-platform software package).
* synchronise Bitrix24 meeting room accounts with MS Exchange.
* realise integration with the electronic document management system.

## Project Implementation

#### A number of steps and resources were required to successfully implement the project:

* audit the site;
* completely redesign it to fit the brand-book;
* integrate with Bitrix24 and P7-Office, which included creating API links, setting up security and ensuring data compatibility;
* synchronise Bitrix24 meeting room accounts with MS Exchange;
* automate the creation and approval of memos, notification and approval systems, as well as databases to store them;
* integrate Bitrix24 with the electronic document management system so that employees can send documents with electronic signatures directly from the portal.

## Project Outcomes

The project united the company's disparate services and processes into a single centralised system. This allowed to significantly increase efficiency and improve business process management.

* As a result of the work performed, employees were able to interact with documents located and stored in R7-Office via the Bitrix24 portal.
* B24 meeting room accounts were synchronised with MS Exchange. It became possible to book them via Outlook and also see their availability in Bitrix24. This increased the transparency and efficiency of meeting room utilisation.
* A separate module for memos appeared on the portal. The service made it possible to automate the process of their creation and approval, as well as to completely eliminate the need for hard copies.
* Thanks to integration with the electronic document management system, employees can send electronically signed documents directly from Bitrix24.

As a result, this project significantly improved the efficiency and transparency of the company's business processes, reduced time and resource costs for routine operations and increased overall productivity.
