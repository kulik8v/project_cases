## Project Description

Cersanit is one of the largest manufacturers of ceramic tiles and porcelain stoneware, as well as sanitary ceramics. Customers have been buying products manufactured under the Cersanit brand since 2002.

The products are manufactured at three modern, technologically advanced plants located in the Moscow Region and the Samara Region. Over 1600 employees work at these automated and environmentally friendly facilities.

After "SalesForce" left the Russian market, the company "Cersanit" faced the task of preserving its data and transferring its workflow to domestic secure software within the shortest possible timeframe. Deep integration of the previously used software with all the company's analytical services made it impractical to rebuild the system from scratch. Therefore, the option of 'creating everything from scratch' was not considered.

## Project Objectives

#### Cersanit set forth the following primary objectives to be addressed when transitioning to the Bitrix24 CRM:

* Standardization of existing business processes.
* Organise the work of the company's employees into a one-stop shop.
* Increasing the efficiency of the company's fieldwork structure.
* Integrating CRM with cross-cutting analytics tools and other information technologies, including ERP.
* Increase the speed of CRM development and customisation, reducing the cost of system ownership

## Project Implementation

#### CRM system Bitrix24 was implemented:

* Basic configuration of Bitrix24 was conducted.
* The organizational structure of the company was established, and users with corresponding roles and access rights were added.
* Work with objects and their interaction in Bitrix was implemented.
* Necessary entities, robots, and smart processes were created.

## Project Outcomes

#### The following results were achieved during the seven months of the project:

* A unified platform was developed for employee collaboration and communication with various roles and levels of access.
* A significant task was successfully implemented - organizing simultaneous work with a substantial number of deals of varying complexity.
* An analytical reporting system was configured with online access for both executives and managers, providing the ability to plan work more effectively and make important strategic decisions.
* The process of planning visits to retail outlets and documenting the results of each visit was automated.
* Templates were standardized, and workflows were automated.
