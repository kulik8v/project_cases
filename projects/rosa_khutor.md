## Project Description

"Rosa Khutor" is a mountain resort located on the banks of the Mzymta River in the Adler District of Sochi.

The resort consists of a network of over 15 hotels, ranging from apartments to five-star accommodations. Even glamping with a five-star service is available on the complex grounds. The infrastructure of Rosa Khutor allows it to claim the title of the largest and most popular ski resort in Russia: 32 modern ski lifts, 105 km of slopes for winter activities, as well as 100 km of trails, 6 cable cars, and its own beach on the Black Sea coast for summer tourism.

In 2020, "Rosa Khutor" received the Russia's Best Ski Resort award for the eighth consecutive year.

## Project Objectives

The management of LLC "Rosa Khutor" has requested optimization of internal business processes in order to increase the company's revenue. As a result of implementing Bitrix24, the aim was to reduce personnel costs associated with managing customer information and room reservations. To accomplish this, automation of over 500 workstations was required.

#### To address this task, specialists from First Bit proposed a phased approach:

* Transitioning call center employees to a unified centralized booking management system.
* Consolidating guest inquiries at the resort into one place.
* Establishing a system for handling complaints and inquiries.
* Implementing a system for accounting and controlling cash refunds for both the cash desk and the online store.
* Standardizing the functions of key departments of the company and channels of communication with guests.

## Project Implementation

Previously, the hotel complex's operations were managed using the OPERA system, a software for hotel management networks.

For the successful implementation of the project, it was necessary to seamlessly export information from the customer's installed system to Bitrix24 without interruptions or halting processes.

A challenge for the implementation team was the differing data formats between Bitrix24 and OPERA.

OPERA was already in use for managing customer and reservation data within the hotel network, while Bitrix24 was implemented for optimizing customer relations and deals. To ensure automatic exchange of this data, an integration between the two systems was developed.

Additionally, when configuring user authorization agreements, it was necessary to consider differences in access rights to avoid confusion in the data. Access rights in Bitrix24 were individually configured for each hotel.

Furthermore, all work had to be constantly coordinated with various hotels and their departments. The global implementation of the new data management technology affected virtually all hotel services.

## Project Outcomes

After the implementation of Bitrix24 in the hotel network of "Rosa Khutor," managing customer flow became simpler and more efficient. All information about guests and reservations began to be collected in the "Unified Window" service—a centralized data view accessible to employees with designated roles.

With the launch of the corporate portal at LLC "Rosa Khutor," a unified digital space was created, gathering data from three sources—OPERA, ISD, and 1C: Trade Management. A deduplication module, specifically developed for this project, analyzes customer data and loads consolidated information into Bitrix24 without duplicates.

This also allowed for:

* Establishing systematic handling of complaints and inquiries.
* Setting up a convenient system for accounting and controlling cash refunds for both the cash desk and the online store.
* Updating the work of managers with guests.
* The operation of the corporate portal in the "Rosa Khutor" hotel network optimized the company's business processes and made the communication system with customers more convenient and transparent. As a result, the level of services provided and customer loyalty increased.

As a result, this project significantly improved the efficiency and transparency of the company's business processes, reduced time and resource costs for routine operations and increased overall productivity.
